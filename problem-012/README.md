# Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number

[Problem write up](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)

- Python solution: `./python/solution.py`

This was an interesting problem, because a brute force solution will not perform well with 500 divisors. 
The following articles illuminated an optimization when finding divisors that greatly helped my solution
perform well.
